# Mysql_assignment_3
This repository contains an SQL assignment focused on creating and manipulating a table named "Managers." The task involves defining the table structure with fields such as Manager_Id, First_name, Last_Name, DOB, Age (with a CHECK constraint), Last_update, Gender, Department, and Salary (marked as NOT NULL). The assignment includes inserting 10 sample records representing diverse managers and executing various queries to demonstrate data retrieval techniques. These queries include retrieving the name and date of birth for the manager with Manager_Id 1, calculating the annual income of all managers, excluding records of a manager named 'Aaliya,' filtering managers in the 'IT' department earning over 25,000 per month, and displaying details of managers with salaries between 10,000 and 35,000. This project provides a practical understanding of fundamental SQL operations and database management.
